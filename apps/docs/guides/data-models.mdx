    A[Months] --> B[Car Registrations]
    A --> C[COE Bidding Results]
    A --> D[COE PQP Rates]
    
    B --> E[Makes]

    C --> H[COE Categories]
    D --> H
    
    E --> I[Registration Numbers]
    F --> I
    G --> I
```

### Data Aggregation

The API provides various aggregation levels:

1. **Individual Records**: Raw data points
2. **Monthly Summaries**: Aggregated by month
3. **Make Summaries**: Aggregated by manufacturer
4. **Fuel Type Summaries**: Aggregated by fuel type
5. **Vehicle Type Summaries**: Aggregated by vehicle type

## Data Quality and Updates

### Update Frequency

- **Car Registration Data**: Monthly (typically mid-month)
- **COE Bidding Data**: Bi-monthly (1st and 3rd Wednesday)
- **COE PQP Data**: Monthly (after COE bidding)

### Data Source

All data is sourced from Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) DataMall, ensuring accuracy and official validation.

### Data Validation

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Usage Patterns

### Common Queries

1. **Monthly Trends**: Get all data for a specific month
2. **Make Comparison**: Compare registrations across manufacturers
3. **Fuel Type Analysis**: Track adoption of different fuel types
4. **COE Market Analysis**: Monitor COE premium trends
5. **Year-over-Year Growth**: Compare same months across years

### Performance Considerations

- **Indexing**: Data is indexed on month, make, and fuel_type
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached with Redis
- **Pagination**: Large datasets are paginated for optimal performance
